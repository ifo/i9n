i9n
===

i9n, aka i18nization, is a library that allows one to ruin text by replacing all
internal characters with a number denoting how many characters were replaced.

As an example, the above paragraph has been i9n'd:

i1n, a1a i9n, i0s a-1a l5y t2t a4s o1e t0o r2n t2t b0y r7g a1l
i6l c8s w2h a-1a n4r d6g h1w m2y c8s w2e r6d.

Which is obviously much more readable, as it saves you time from having to read
all of those pesky middle characters.

usage

Simply require i9n and you're ready to ruin some text. Literally:

```js
const i9n = require('i9n');

let ruinedText = i9n.ruin('this text is far to slow to read and write.');

console.log(ruinedText);
// t2s t2t i0s f1r t0o s2w t0o r2d a1d w3e.
```

If you only want to see one word that has been made more efficient, you can use
the i9n function by itself:

```js
const i9n = require('i9n');

console.log(i9n.i9n('internationalization'));
// i18n
```

Go have some fun! Err, rather, G0o h2e s2e f1n!
